**BLM, trans gender rights and other moral crusades are being exploited to avoid addressing larger, more pervasive and expensive issues.  The biggest losers in this are Women.**

## Morality is often turned into a cartoon

People enjoy feeling ‘right’. Our brains are pattern recognition sponges that continuously bash the world into a shape resembling our vision of reality, the subjective or, amongst a group of us, the shared reality of the intersubjective.  With only one point of reference it’s difficult for us to analyse our impression of the facts to ascertain whether our version matches the objective, the Truth.  It’s not satisfying to calmly rationalise when all we want to do is have a scrap, whether it’s in 7/11 carpark or on twitter.  
Because of our lack of patience, or an innate critical thinking toolkit, Morality has always been at risk of being over simplified so it can fit into a convenient narrative, typically polarised into **Right/Wrong**.  This turns a multifaceted 3 dimensional problem set into a child’s cartoon.  This process is being exacerbated through social media and our consumption of mass cultural entertainment that scratches our zealous itch.  

For example, in the final two Avengers film (spoilers?), half the people in the universe die because the heroes refuse to sacrifice their integrity and kill one of their own.  They are ultimately vindicated. This uncompromisingly *Good* approach to ethical standing is a common trope in mass cultural entertainment in the ego centric West.  An uncompromising, unpragmatic and ultimately unhelpful approach to ethics is effectively the cartoonisation of the Moral High Ground.  It obfuscates any process of compromise to drive change forwards at an achievable pace.  The age of cancel culture was inevitable. 

Morality is a subjective thing.  It is fluid, and subject itself to definition given that it’s meaning can vary wildly.  Context is king.  Morality itself isn’t an ethereally complicated issue so much as one that requires hard work, nuance and patience to understand because it changes and evolves depending upon the stakes and the context, because it is at it’s root an opinion.  It’s far more satisfying to forgo this nuance, over simply an issue and simply rage, levying moral issues into righteous superiority.  It feels good, and if you’re not over encumbered with behavioural intelligence, you’ll never know you’re not a hero.

How does this apply to issues that are genuinely abhorrent?  After all, Trans people should certainly not have to suffer in order to safeguard the sensibilities of religious biggots and idiots.  People should not be unfairly discriminated against because they happen to have a different skin colour.  

As pernicious as these issues are however, the BLM and trans rights movements are examples of minority discrimination movements being cynically exploited to forgo real change in our society.  These causes are vital and require championing, but they should be championed alongside bigger ethical concerns not be permitted to supplant them. 

## Womens rights are losing out to minority issues, and this suits corporate and governmental interest.

50-51% of the human race are women.  Women are systematically discriminated against.  This will continue unless we re-appraise our moral focus to account for ethical issues that dwarf the minority of colour racist idiots and sexually insecure lunatics who account for the bigotry of certain minority’s.   

In the **1st world** West, the discrimination against women is often incidental with an undercurrent of pseudo-religious gender stereotyping; societies largely have not grappled with the issue of ensuring primary caregiving parents are not unfairly discriminated against in their careers for working fewer hours to care for their children.  It just so happens that this mostly affects women.  The fact that discrimination is at least partly incidental rather than deliberate doesn’t make it any less pernicious.

Watching a man with darker skin be executed is so visibly shocking and horrifying, that when it’s magnified through the lens of social media it’s to envisage what could be important.  In an age of immediate video, these images form a visceral emotive connection with viewers.  As a consequence it trumps 3 billion people (women/caregivers) facing non violent day to day discrimination.  We need to regain our societal perspective, and ensure that the bigger issues are not cynically neglected due a minority of monstrous events.
*Social Media Outrage!* is the cartoon we’re all watching, willingly or otherwise.  It over simplifies the world we live in and encourages us to put all our energy into addressing one or two emotive (and monstrous) topics that affect a minority of the populace.  Whilst we need to put some of our energy into this, as a society we should not be putting all our focus into it when there are bigger issues affecting a much, much larger portion of the population.  We have to at least find a balance and be cognisant of the less dramatic but more pernicious issues endemic in our society. 

## Societies need to protect caregivers, and in effect women, in order to ensure moral and economic development progresses.  

The big questions is – How do we define value.

The fact is, addressing caregiver/gender equality requires addressing individual value and rights that will fundamentally evolve our society and drive positive change for all minority groups.  What do we value?  Are forests important? Not according to shareholder interest.  Re-defining ‘value’ requires the status quo to change, and with it a public and private sector seemingly enslaved to asinine short termism.

## In the meantime, BLM, Trans Rights and other minority issues are being abused to avoid ‘real’ societal change.

Companies, Governments and 3rd sector organisations are exploiting popularist liberty movements to avoid addressing the largest fault line in Western societies ethical journey; gender equality and the re-distribution of care giver equity (ensuring that society is structured to minimise career disruption and thus discrimination due to caregiving). Instead, organisations address the cartoonish ‘colour racism’ endemic in America, but far less commonplace in other parts of the West compared with cultural xenophobia, in as well as issues such as trans rights.

Trans rights, like overt racism, are an example of an important but smaller issue taking precedence over fundamental societal change.  [‘0.6% of adults’]( https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/trans-adults-united-states/) in the US identify as transgender. Whilst the heartless discrimination of these people is abhorrent, it’s an economically expedient issue to deal with.  Because most people don’t care, and aren’t prepared to be cruel due to a sexual hang ups or ruthless adherence to the **implied** teachings of a magic baby. 

The **Dummies Guide to Avoiding Structural Reform in the Workplace** guide is a simple process: kick start an initiative in a white collar organisation aimed at tackling colour racism (the idiots flavour of discrimination) or transgender rights.  It’s cheap and easy.  For very little investment or change, the organisation manages to achieve the conjurer’s trick of appearing to be an equality champion, whilst avoiding doing any hard work to address gender equality, caregiver equity, the concept of output over time focus - or any other meritocratic principles that require trusting employees.  There will always be a luckless ‘Gary in accounting’ who’s an undiagnosed member of the Autistic Spectrum and falls foul of overt discrimination.  The subsequent witch hunt and re-education campaign will be irrefutable proof of the organisations ‘goodness’, and staves off the need to deal with the fact that half the company’s workforce is under paid, under valued and not fairly supported. 

With respect to the relevance of Trans rights compared with bigger issues, let’s put the 0.6% statistic into scale, [2.16% of adults]( https://www.mencap.org.uk/learning-disability-explained/research-and-statistics/how-common-learning-disability) in the UK have a learning disability.  This severely impacts their capacity to operate within society, and often leads to full or part time care just to function, let alone have a higher quality of life.  Conservative governments in the West are continually cutting funding expecting charity’s to pick up the slack.  In the USA where socialism is IN many quarters considered synonymous with satanism, helping the learning disabled is (in a depressing twist of hollow irony) borderline ungodly, given the bible belts affinity with unregulated market capitalism (eerily reminiscent of Wahabi Islam’s unholy alliance with Saudi fiscal policy). 

But, learning disability issues live in the social media shadows.  Because they’re not as exotic or exciting to be outraged  about. No penis amputation or state sanctioned ethnic murder to see here.

Advocating for transgender rights is important, but this is a minority issue that easily inspires debate and has been cynically abused by corporate algorithms  to railroad the largest equality/equity issue of our time; the discrimination of Women.  Women account for 50-51% of humans, but lose out and take a back step to moral concerns that are more interesting, and distorted in scale through the magnifying lens of social media, taking precedence in the media.

## Caregivers and thus Women Losing Out

With respect to care givers, individuals regardless of gender should be protected in their careers from the negative impact of caregiving.  

Raising children is an incredibly complex task that forces you to develop as an adult or collapse in yourself like a dead plant.  The idea that raising independent human beings to be effective members of society isn’t a complex demanding task, that wont provide you with generic skills (particular in managerial and customer facing roles), that peers may not have, is so *illogical* it stems of religious infatuation with the status quo.  The idea that time served over output should equate to corporate success is sadly the status quo, but that doesn’t mean it’s not madness.

Whilst it’s about the individual, if a group ends up being discriminated against it doesn’t matter whether it’s incidental or deliberate.  That group is Women.

women are actively seeing their rights and value eroded.  For example: the cancel culture-esque approach to removing gender pronouns from maternity wards in [the city of Brighton UK]( https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-56007728), because it’s insensitive to the a portion of the 0.6% of trans people.  *Women* are biologically distinct and have to put up with the burden of growing and birthing humans for the race to continue.  Societies job is to ensure they are compensated fairly for this whilst remaining as meritocratic as possible. 

The narrative implies that women are no longer entitled to be recognised as having ‘different’ needs, despite the fact that biologically *they can grow a human*.  This is madness. Women are cognitively identical but biologically different from men, and make up 51% percent of the population (based on chromosomes/birth gender).  

They should be treated fairly by society compared with male and non-binary genders.  We need them to have a species.  The fact is they have to be pregnant, give birth, and ideally breast feed (if able).  Non genetic females do not.

Saving the feelings of 0.6% of the population to belittle the suffering of 51% is Marvel esque absurdism that would not be out of place in Kafka’s work.  

The free market algorithm certainly wont address this issue.  There’s no quick buck to me made here. Governments need to step in.
##How should governments address this is in the immediate term?  

*Take a page out of Norway’s book; publish (publicly) the annual income and tax paid for every individual earning above a certain threshold in the respective country.  The cult of the free market can’t stand up to the gravity of the mass dissent that will follow.  This would even help mitigate legal tax cheating, with the public vilification of celebrities and entrepreneurs who use the tools our governments have given them.*

## How do we move forward as a society in the long term?

Value itself must be valued. 

With respect to addressing this In the long term, academics prophesise the coming Anarchy of the robot revolution that will force our hand.  Believing in Force Majeur is temping, but lazy.  I’m sceptical.  Robots are expensive and serviceable, poor humans are cheap and forgettable.  The asinine cult of the unregulated market is leading to a pan-governmental squeeze on the middle class, which will lead to further impoverishment and a return to the age of inherited wealth; the new aristocracy.  This isn’t going to help the evolution of equity in any of our societies.  Slavery didn’t go away when Lincoln won the war, it just changed.  Slightly.  The laptop I used to write this was probably built by **serfs**, the difference being pedantic.

## Our battleground: The Future.  

Until we as species re-evaluate value itself, we will remain in a viral stage of our evolution.  Deistic belief structures remove the fear of apocalyptic consequences, whilst exacerbating the pressure to breed.   Popularist moral brinkmanship is every bit a cancer as irrational discrimination.

Shareholder interest isn’t magically going to solve anything for us.

This isn’t the 60’s, or even the 00’s.  The **Truth** will no longer get you laid, but a ruthless adherence to speaking truth to power is the only recourse against the cancellers and racists - fascists all.  We can either live in a cartoon whilst the 3 dimensional world around us burns, or we can put the twitter account down, let go of asinine righteous zeal, and do some hard work to address value in our society based on objective reality, not what’s expedient or easy.  Let’s start with transparency, and see how far the tide can take us.
