Companies, Governments and 3rd sector organisations are cynically exploiting popularist liberty movements to avoid addressing the most serious fault line in Western societies; gender equality and the re-distribution of care giver equity (ensuring that society is structured to minimise career disruption and thus discrimination due to caregiving). Instead, they address the cartoonish (but monstrous) ‘colour racism’ endemic in America, but which is far less commonplace in other parts of the West compared with cultural xenophobia.  
Trans rights are another example of a small issue taking precedence over fundamental societal change.  [‘0.6% of adults’]( https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/trans-adults-united-states/) in the US identify as transgender. Whilst the heartless discrimination of these people is abhorrent, it’s an economically expedient issue to deal with.  Kick starting an initiative in a white collar Western organisation aimed at tackling colour racism (the idiots flavour of discrimination) or transgender rights is cheap and easy.  For very little investment or change, the organisation manages to achieve the conjurer’s trick of appearing to be an equality champion, an avatar of French revolution naivete, whilst avoiding doing any hard work to address the biggest fault line in our society; gender equality and caregiver equity.  There will always be a luckless Gary in accounting who’s undiagnosed but is on the Autistic Spectrum and falls foul of overt discrimination.  The subsequent witch hunt and re-education campaign is irrefutable proof of the organisations ‘goodness’, and staves off the need to deal with the fact that half the company’s workforce is under paid, under valued and not fairly supported. 

To put the 0.6% statistic into scale, [2.16% of adults]( https://www.mencap.org.uk/learning-disability-explained/research-and-statistics/how-common-learning-disability) in the UK have a learning disability which severely impacts their capacity to operate within society.  Advocating for transgender rights is important, but the fact is that this is a minority issue that easily inspires debate, and has been cynically used by corporate algorithms to railroad the largest equality/equity issue of our civilisation.

Further evidence that women are suffering as a result of popularist fringe issues that are exciting to fired up about, is the cancel culture-esque approach to removing gender pronouns from maternity wards in [the city of Brighton UK]( https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-56007728).  If we apply this to the world and assume an even split in the 0.6% figure along gender lines (disclosure: I have no evidence for this assumption), that means 50.7% of the human population are no longer entitled to be recognised as having ‘different’ needs, because biologically *they can grow a fucking human*.  Women are biologically different from men, make up 51% percent of the population (based on chromosomes/birth gender), and should be treated fairly by society compared with male and non-binary genders, given that we need them to have a species.  That means ensuring that individuals, regardless of gender, should be protected in their careers from the negative impact of caregiving and we all should all suck it up to pay the price this will entail.  It’s about the individual, but if a group ends up being discriminated against, it doesn’t matter whether it’s incidental or deliberate.  The cost is the same. The free market algorithm certainly wont address this.  There’s no quick buck to me made here. Governments need to step.

**And how should they address this is in the immediate term?  - Take a page out of Norway’s book; publish (publicly) the annual income and tax paid for every individual earning above a certain threshold in the respective country.  The cult of the free market can’t stand up to the gravity of the mass dissent that will follow.  This would even help mitigate legal tax cheating, with the public vilification of celebrities and entrepreneurs who use the tools our governments have given them.**  

Long term, I welcome academics prophesising the Anarchy of the robot revolution.  Truthfully I don’t think it will happen.  Robots are expensive and serviceable, poor humans are cheap and forgettable.  The insane cult of the unregulated market is leading to a pan-governmental squeeze on the middle class, which will lead to further impoverishment and a return to the age of inherited wealth; the new aristocracy.  This isn’t going to help the evolution of equity in any of our societies.  

Until we as species re-evaluate value itself, we will remain in a viral stage of our evolution.  Deistic belief structures removed the fear of apocalyptic consequences, whilst exacerbating the pressure to breed.   Popularist moral brinkmanship is every bit a cancer as irrational discrimination.
Shareholder interest isn’t magically going to do this for us.

This isn’t the 60’s, or even the 00’s.  The #Truth# will no longer get you laid, but a ruthless adherence to speaking truth to power is the only recourse against the cancellers and racists - fascists all.  We can either live in a cartoon whilst the 3 dimensional world around us burns, or we can put the twitter account down, let go of asinine righteous zeal, and do some hard work to address value in our society based on objective reality, not what’s expedient or easy.  Let’s start with transparency, and see how far the tide can take us.
