Media outlets have failed to report the likely creative writing origins of QAnon.  This oversight is extremely important with respect to undermining the narrative of shameless QAnon aficionados who have turned a creative writing exercise into something between a doomsday cult and a pyramid scheme, with real life consequences.  
In November 2017 a YouTube video creator working with two moderators of the 4chan website, began plugging specific anonymous posts ([dated October 2017](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/12/qanon-4chan-the-storm-conspiracy-explained.html)) pulled from amidst the many conspiracy theories posted on 4chan.

These conspiracy theories claimed they were authored by ‘Q’, who portended to be an anonymous high-ranking (US) military officer.  The theories therein espoused by Q – the world is run by an international child sacrifice and sexual abuse satanic cult controlled by senior democrats, only Donald Trump can save us – would result in QAnon transforming from conspiracy hobby to international cult with significant financial and political clout.

None of this is new information; it’s [well documented](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/how-three-conspiracy-theorists-took-q-sparked-qanon-n900531) that the 3 individuals who picked out these posts by ‘Q’ and plugged them, have benefitted financially from the increased digital footfall they’ve experienced through their respective platforms.  It’s theorised that they probably authored these comments, or at least assumed the writing mantle at some point.  What’s not been covered, despite the fact it’s easily accessible to anyone with an internet connection, is the likely creative writing origin of QAnon; True Detective series 1 and the more obscure MotherHorseEyes narrative.

Satanic child murdering orchestrated and participated in by politicians is lifted right out of True Detective.  A narrative as cartoony and shocking as this is not hard to come up with.  It may be coincidental, harkening back to Medieval notions of Satanically inspired nobles with a penchant for doing the worst thing they could think of.  But = it’s a significant coincidence.   In fact it is exactly the same story.  And True Detective Season 1 came out in 2014 to critical acclaim, causing a spike in popularity for The King in Yellow, anything Carcosa, and helped reinvigorate Lovecratian fandom with the incredible sense of cosmic despair the expertly crafted series instils in the viewer.  
A lot of people have seen the series or at least heard about it, and the parallels are obvious.  What isn’t as mainstream is what occurred in July 2016, just over a year before the first post by ‘Q’ in October 2017: the ‘creepypasta’ [creative writing narrative](https://www.reddit.com/r/9M9H9E9/wiki/narrative) authored by _9MOTHER9HORSE9EYES9 (mother horse eyes).
This entertaining narrative took the form of a series of reddit posts release between April and July 2016, detailing several emergent narratives that came together.  It reads like the pitch for an excellent sci fi novel about the humanities destruction/enslavement at the hands of a superior consciousness, with a strong current of ‘flesh horror’ throughout.  The piece introduced a sinister, anonymous, otherworldly presence that acts as the Big Bad/protagonist throughout, and named it ‘Q’.  What Q is, is to a degree open to interpretation.  Nothing more has been published.  There’s been no book detail, no explanation, just a Reddit entry that gained large traction on it’s way to being lucratively monetised… and then stopped.  A mysterious entity called Q, named in a creative writing project on Reddit that managed to receive coverage in well-respected British Newspaper [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/05/9mother9horse9eyes9-the-mysterious-tale-terrifying-reddit), seemingly disappeared from the creative writing scene.

Barely more than a year later a fictional character called Q was telling us that our children were being trafficked by Democrats who wanted to ritually sacrifice them in the name of Satan.  The 3 Amigos of thought crime, or a separate QAnon author, could simply have picked a letter in the alphabet they thought sounded cool (James Bonds long suffering Scientist is called Q).  But given the audacious hack rip off/copy & paste True Detective plot line, the fact that mother horse eyes was well known amongst the Reddit community and the authors were active participants, the time line looks like one hell of a coincidence: 

[True Detective (2014)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_Detective_(season_1)) > [9MOTHER9HORSE9EYES9 (2016)](https://www.reddit.com/r/9M9H9E9/wiki/narrative) > [QAnon (2017)](https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-is-qanon-what-we-know-about-the-conspiracy-theory-11597694801).

Understanding this origin is essential to forming a rational picture of how the pieces came together.  Drawing attention to a Reddit piece about Flesh interfaces and cosmic horror -in order to frame the narrative origins of QAnon as a creative writing project monetised and subsequently weaponised - is a small but important battle in the war for our minds.  QAnon doesn’t end with TRUMP.  It has presented a monstrous narrative that railroads common sense into submission through emotive necessity, and has become the vehicle carrying numerous other conspiracies that may die or at least wither in isolation; vaccines are bad for you, 5G causes COVID, climate change is a lie, the Earth is flat.  

As a species, from the earliest days of Palaeolithic campfires, we’ve thrived on stories; for the vast majority of our time of earth, oral tradition has been the primary means through which we preserve, modify and articulate our shared understanding of events and ideas.  This is reflected in the structure of our brain which is poorly optimised for written language analysis, compared with our capacity to communicate orally.

Whilst our methodology for communicating has evolved rapidly, with technology far outpacing biological adaptation, understanding narrative is still essential to understanding what information really is.  We may have sophisticated written languages and IT tools, but our brains are broadly the same.  Data is nothing without some kind of validity or ‘truth’ assessment – a method with which to weigh it’s likely veracity common in intelligence services. 

Depending on the individual, conspiracy thinking is either a failure in rationalisation (born from insecurity and driven by necessity), intellectual laziness, or a combination exacerbated by evolution;  our brains are pattern recognition machines continually seeking to conserve energy.  Born from necessity to survive, this often leads to entrenched views/polarisation, confirmation bias and ‘logic traps’, wherein a shared subjective reality with arbitrary and transient rules often Trumps objective reality.  Objective reality is an elusive concept when as individuals we have only one point of 1st hand reference.  But it’s there, and striving towards it should be the aim of any person seeking to evolve beyond the architecture of our being.  Or at least try to lengthen the distance between human communities and Baboon rock.

Monetised and/or weaponised conspiracy theories threaten our cognitive development.  We live in an era where selfmade millionaires and professionals who graduated high school sometimes believe the world is flat.  Understanding the narrative - the story - behind the demise of common sense is overlooked at our peril.

> ### On a further note:

> I've taken part in a critical thinking skills training course which involves a lesson and exercise in conspiracy thinking.  Syndicates are split for and against, and presented with conspiracy theories including Flat Earth and 5G.  They have to present an argument to the audience who vote on who seems the most convincing .  
The participants are generally high functioning ‘white collar’ professionals.  But the amateur conspiracy theorists broughthave always brought it home for the win.  Every time. Why?  Science is hard, Crusades are easy.  It’s more natural to form an emotional attachment to emotive sentiments than to cold hard facts.  Of course the audience knew it was baloney, but the lesson regarding how even well educated people can fall for nonsense hits home.  
There’s a palpable silence in the room when it does.
