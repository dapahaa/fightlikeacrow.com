### Beneath the skin of any Nihilist lingers the corpse of an empathic soul disappointed with this shitshow. 

Humanity is not a virus like the eco-fascists would have us believe.  But we do appear to be in an evolutionary stage of 'viral activity'.

Insecurity is the mother of all fuckups.  Most at least. Scared people often make poor choices.  

The Earth is flat, vaccines are dangerous.  The Amazon rainforest is worth more as toilet paper than as a rainforest.

Capitalism is a fact of life, but the myth that the shot-term focussed algorithms of unrestricted markets are itâ€™s true righteous form (and that this will safeguard our future) is at best, completely absurd.  At worst, it is a permissive cult.

But, for all that is opposed to us down here in the belly of common sense and post-teen angst, there is hope.

Hope that we can shatter the paradigm of short termism and reclaim Utopia as a concept, and with it our compassion.

For now, join us as a fellow traveller, ever so slightly beyond the line of sanity, Reluctantly Nihilist, - *until the world stops chimping.*
