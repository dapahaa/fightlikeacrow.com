<h2 id="morality-is-often-turned-into-a-cartoon">Morality is often turned into a cartoon</h2>
<p>People enjoy feeling ‘right’. Our brains are pattern recognition sponges that continuously bash the world into a shape resembling our vision of reality, the subjective or, amongst a group of us, the shared reality of the intersubjective.  With only one point of reference it’s difficult for us to analyse our impression of the facts to ascertain whether our version matches the objective, the Truth.  It’s not satisfying to calmly rationalise when all we want to do is have a scrap, whether it’s in 7/11 carpark or on twitter.<br>
Because of our lack of patience, or an innate critical thinking toolkit, Morality has always been at risk of being over simplified so it can fit into a convenient narrative, typically polarised into <strong>Right/Wrong</strong>.  This turns a multifaceted 3 dimensional problem set into a child’s cartoon.  This process is being exacerbated through social media and our consumption of mass cultural entertainment that scratches our zealous itch.</p>
<p>For example, in the final two Avengers film (spoilers?), half the people in the universe die because the heroes refuse to sacrifice their integrity and kill one of their own.  They are ultimately vindicated. This uncompromisingly <em>Good</em> approach to ethical standing is a common trope in mass cultural entertainment in the ego centric West.  An uncompromising, unpragmatic and ultimately unhelpful approach to ethics is effectively the cartoonisation of the Moral High Ground.  It obfuscates any process of compromise to drive change forwards at an achievable pace.  The age of cancel culture was inevitable.</p>
<p>Morality is a subjective thing.  It is fluid, and subject itself to definition given that it’s meaning can vary wildly.  Context is king.  Morality itself isn’t an ethereally complicated issue so much as one that requires hard work, nuance and patience to understand because it changes and evolves depending upon the stakes and the context, because it is at it’s root an opinion.  It’s far more satisfying to forgo this nuance, over simply an issue and simply rage, levying moral issues into righteous superiority.  It feels good, and if you’re not over encumbered with behavioural intelligence, you’ll never know you’re not a hero.</p>
<p>How does this apply to issues that are genuinely abhorrent?  After all, Trans people should certainly not have to suffer in order to safeguard the sensibilities of religious biggots and idiots.  People should not be unfairly discriminated against because they happen to have a different skin colour.</p>
<p>As pernicious as these issues are however, the BLM and trans rights movements are examples of minority discrimination movements being cynically exploited to forgo real change in our society.  These causes are vital and require championing, but they should be championed alongside bigger ethical concerns not be permitted to supplant them.</p>
<h2 id="womens-rights-are-losing-out-to-minority-issues-and-this-suits-corporate-and-governmental-interest">Womens rights are losing out to minority issues, and this suits corporate and governmental interest.</h2>
<p>50-51% of the human race are women.  Women are systematically discriminated against.  This will continue unless we re-appraise our moral focus to account for ethical issues that dwarf the minority of colour racist idiots and sexually insecure lunatics who account for the bigotry of certain minority’s.</p>
<p>In the <strong>1st world</strong> West, the discrimination against women is often incidental with an undercurrent of pseudo-religious gender stereotyping; societies largely have not grappled with the issue of ensuring primary caregiving parents are not unfairly discriminated against in their careers for working fewer hours to care for their children.  It just so happens that this mostly affects women.  The fact that discrimination is at least partly incidental rather than deliberate doesn’t make it any less pernicious.</p>
<p>Watching a man with darker skin be executed is so visibly shocking and horrifying, that when it’s magnified through the lens of social media it’s to envisage what could be important.  In an age of immediate video, these images form a visceral emotive connection with viewers.  As a consequence it trumps 3 billion people (women/caregivers) facing non violent day to day discrimination.  We need to regain our societal perspective, and ensure that the bigger issues are not cynically neglected due a minority of monstrous events.
<em>Social Media Outrage!</em> is the cartoon we’re all watching, willingly or otherwise.  It over simplifies the world we live in and encourages us to put all our energy into addressing one or two emotive (and monstrous) topics that affect a minority of the populace.  Whilst we need to put some of our energy into this, as a society we should not be putting all our focus into it when there are bigger issues affecting a much, much larger portion of the population.  We have to at least find a balance and be cognisant of the less dramatic but more pernicious issues endemic in our society.</p>
<h2 id="societies-need-to-protect-caregivers-and-in-effect-women-in-order-to-ensure-moral-and-economic-development-progresses">Societies need to protect caregivers, and in effect women, in order to ensure moral and economic development progresses.</h2>
<p>The big questions is – How do we define value.</p>
<p>The fact is, addressing caregiver/gender equality requires addressing individual value and rights that will fundamentally evolve our society and drive positive change for all minority groups.  What do we value?  Are forests important? Not according to shareholder interest.  Re-defining ‘value’ requires the status quo to change, and with it a public and private sector seemingly enslaved to asinine short termism.</p>
<h2 id="in-the-meantime-blm-trans-rights-and-other-minority-issues-are-being-abused-to-avoid-real-societal-change">In the meantime, BLM, Trans Rights and other minority issues are being abused to avoid ‘real’ societal change.</h2>
<p>Companies, Governments and 3rd sector organisations are exploiting popularist liberty movements to avoid addressing the largest fault line in Western societies ethical journey; gender equality and the re-distribution of care giver equity (ensuring that society is structured to minimise career disruption and thus discrimination due to caregiving). Instead, organisations address the cartoonish ‘colour racism’ endemic in America, but far less commonplace in other parts of the West compared with cultural xenophobia, in as well as issues such as trans rights.</p>
<p>Trans rights, like overt racism, are an example of an important but smaller issue taking precedence over fundamental societal change.  <a href="https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/trans-adults-united-states/">‘0.6% of adults’</a> in the US identify as transgender. Whilst the heartless discrimination of these people is abhorrent, it’s an economically expedient issue to deal with.  Because most people don’t care, and aren’t prepared to be cruel due to a sexual hang ups or ruthless adherence to the <strong>implied</strong> teachings of a magic baby.</p>
<p>The <strong>Dummies Guide to Avoiding Structural Reform in the Workplace</strong> guide is a simple process: kick start an initiative in a white collar organisation aimed at tackling colour racism (the idiots flavour of discrimination) or transgender rights.  It’s cheap and easy.  For very little investment or change, the organisation manages to achieve the conjurer’s trick of appearing to be an equality champion, whilst avoiding doing any hard work to address gender equality, caregiver equity, the concept of output over time focus - or any other meritocratic principles that require trusting employees.  There will always be a luckless ‘Gary in accounting’ who’s an undiagnosed member of the Autistic Spectrum and falls foul of overt discrimination.  The subsequent witch hunt and re-education campaign will be irrefutable proof of the organisations ‘goodness’, and staves off the need to deal with the fact that half the company’s workforce is under paid, under valued and not fairly supported.</p>
<p>With respect to the relevance of Trans rights compared with bigger issues, let’s put the 0.6% statistic into scale, <a href="https://www.mencap.org.uk/learning-disability-explained/research-and-statistics/how-common-learning-disability">2.16% of adults</a> in the UK have a learning disability.  This severely impacts their capacity to operate within society, and often leads to full or part time care just to function, let alone have a higher quality of life.  Conservative governments in the West are continually cutting funding expecting charity’s to pick up the slack.  In the USA where socialism is IN many quarters considered synonymous with satanism, helping the learning disabled is (in a depressing twist of hollow irony) borderline ungodly, given the bible belts affinity with unregulated market capitalism (eerily reminiscent of Wahabi Islam’s unholy alliance with Saudi fiscal policy).</p>
<p>But, learning disability issues live in the social media shadows.  Because they’re not as exotic or exciting to be outraged  about. No penis amputation or state sanctioned ethnic murder to see here.</p>
<p>Advocating for transgender rights is important, but this is a minority issue that easily inspires debate and has been cynically abused by corporate algorithms  to railroad the largest equality/equity issue of our time; the discrimination of Women.  Women account for 50-51% of humans, but lose out and take a back step to moral concerns that are more interesting, and distorted in scale through the magnifying lens of social media, taking precedence in the media.</p>
<h2 id="caregivers-and-thus-women-losing-out">Caregivers and thus Women Losing Out</h2>
<p>With respect to care givers, individuals regardless of gender should be protected in their careers from the negative impact of caregiving.</p>
<p>Raising children is an incredibly complex task that forces you to develop as an adult or collapse in yourself like a dead plant.  The idea that raising independent human beings to be effective members of society isn’t a complex demanding task, that wont provide you with generic skills (particular in managerial and customer facing roles), that peers may not have, is so <em>illogical</em> it stems of religious infatuation with the status quo.  The idea that time served over output should equate to corporate success is sadly the status quo, but that doesn’t mean it’s not madness.</p>
<p>Whilst it’s about the individual, if a group ends up being discriminated against it doesn’t matter whether it’s incidental or deliberate.  That group is Women.</p>
<p>women are actively seeing their rights and value eroded.  For example: the cancel culture-esque approach to removing gender pronouns from maternity wards in <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-56007728">the city of Brighton UK</a>, because it’s insensitive to the a portion of the 0.6% of trans people.  <em>Women</em> are biologically distinct and have to put up with the burden of growing and birthing humans for the race to continue.  Societies job is to ensure they are compensated fairly for this whilst remaining as meritocratic as possible.</p>
<p>The narrative implies that women are no longer entitled to be recognised as having ‘different’ needs, despite the fact that biologically <em>they can grow a human</em>.  This is madness. Women are cognitively identical but biologically different from men, and make up 51% percent of the population (based on chromosomes/birth gender).</p>
<p>They should be treated fairly by society compared with male and non-binary genders.  We need them to have a species.  The fact is they have to be pregnant, give birth, and ideally breast feed (if able).  Non genetic females do not.</p>
<p>Saving the feelings of 0.6% of the population to belittle the suffering of 51% is Marvel esque absurdism that would not be out of place in Kafka’s work.</p>
<p>The free market algorithm certainly wont address this issue.  There’s no quick buck to me made here. Governments need to step in.
##How should governments address this is in the immediate term?</p>
<p><em>Take a page out of Norway’s book; publish (publicly) the annual income and tax paid for every individual earning above a certain threshold in the respective country.  The cult of the free market can’t stand up to the gravity of the mass dissent that will follow.  This would even help mitigate legal tax cheating, with the public vilification of celebrities and entrepreneurs who use the tools our governments have given them.</em></p>
<h2 id="how-do-we-move-forward-as-a-society-in-the-long-term">How do we move forward as a society in the long term?</h2>
<p>Value itself must be valued.</p>
<p>With respect to addressing this In the long term, academics prophesise the coming Anarchy of the robot revolution that will force our hand.  Believing in Force Majeur is temping, but lazy.  I’m sceptical.  Robots are expensive and serviceable, poor humans are cheap and forgettable.  The asinine cult of the unregulated market is leading to a pan-governmental squeeze on the middle class, which will lead to further impoverishment and a return to the age of inherited wealth; the new aristocracy.  This isn’t going to help the evolution of equity in any of our societies.  Slavery didn’t go away when Lincoln won the war, it just changed.  Slightly.  The laptop I used to write this was probably built by <strong>serfs</strong>, the difference being pedantic.</p>
<h2 id="our-battleground-the-future">Our battleground: The Future.</h2>
<p>Until we as species re-evaluate value itself, we will remain in a viral stage of our evolution.  Deistic belief structures remove the fear of apocalyptic consequences, whilst exacerbating the pressure to breed.   Popularist moral brinkmanship is every bit a cancer as irrational discrimination.</p>
<p>Shareholder interest isn’t magically going to solve anything for us.</p>
<p>This isn’t the 60’s, or even the 00’s.  The <strong>Truth</strong> will no longer get you laid, but a ruthless adherence to speaking truth to power is the only recourse against the cancellers and racists - fascists all.  We can either live in a cartoon whilst the 3 dimensional world around us burns, or we can put the twitter account down, let go of asinine righteous zeal, and do some hard work to address value in our society based on objective reality, not what’s expedient or easy.  Let’s start with transparency, and see how far the tide can take us.</p>

			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="the-short">The Short</h1>
<p>Google is known for ingenuity, a talented and happy workforce, and an eye watering bottom line.  Businesses idolise Google, and want to be more like it, lionising it’s tactics and dropping pseudo management jargon filled mission statements like slam poems to indicate this. But despite airs to the contrary, most are unwilling to actually make the basic but fundamental changes necessary:</p>
<p><strong>Trusting and empowering employees to be suitably autonomous, recognising management as a separate facilitative vocation, and using ‘HR’ as common sense police; helping the organisation strategically by propagating a culture of transparency and facilitating long term, compassionate investment in people themselves.</strong></p>
<p>Instead, businesses treat management as a hierarchical position gained through success in an unrelated skillset, but synonymous with increased pay, benefits, prestige and thus, <em>advancement/progress</em>.  Even when people are terrible at it.</p>
<p>This anachronistic approach is still commonplace and exacerbated by widespread HR practises that in practice are nothing more than border line autistic spreadsheet management, despite the collective delusion that these businesses treat HR as something other than payroll + <em>the tick box don’t get sued crew</em>.</p>
<p>Employees remain untrusted, unempowered, and non-autonomous.</p>
<p>But businesses <em>do</em> buy play rooms for their employees who are often afraid to be seen using them instead of working.  Who needs a cure to broken legs when you can just keep applying stickie plasters and take a dice roll on the quarters results?</p>
<p><strong>On the cutting edge of common sense, micromanagement is structurally impossible, because <strong>Management</strong> is dead.  Long live <em>management</em>.</strong></p>
<h1 id="the-long">The Long</h1>
<p>Google is namedropped when somebody wants to demonstrate success, innovation or an overwhelmingly positive work environment (<em>we’ll save toxic echo chamber algorithms for another day</em>).  The name of the company has become a buzzword for marrying financial success with employee satisfaction; <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/pavelkrapivin/2018/09/17/how-googles-strategy-for-happy-employees-boosts-its-bottom-line/">‘Googles strategy for happy employees boosts it’s bottom line’</a>.  It shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone.  In an increasingly globalised world, many companies have good ideas, but the company with the best people is going to come out on top.  Google has mastered HR by not doing <em>HR</em>, a technique designed and propagated by the founders and the former Senior Vice President of People Operations, Laszlo Bock.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In 2015 Bock published <strong>Work Rules!</strong>, ‘a practical guide to help people find meaning in work and improve the way they live and lead’ – in essence what HR looks like in Google.  It’s an excellent read, and has offered far greater value than all the texts I was semi-forced to digest throughout my (work funded) Business Masters program.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Business academics is <em>mostly</em> generated by people who have failed in business, academics or both.  This is why business textbooks read like a sentient calculator tried to make sense of basic human interaction.</p>
<p>Continuing this theme in obfuscation (because emotions are hard), bureaucratic HR processes are typically devised by a few sane(ish) Necromancers.  They are subsequently sold/taught/distributed by a dead eyed army of underpaid, sub-competent accountants, caught in an anguished parody of half-life.  Typically lacking in empathy and compassion, they masquerade as academics and professionals concerned with people, and presumably worship Spreadsheet macros from the windows 95 era.</p>
<p>A cursory search of my nearest university for HR/Human Resources texts reveals 15,769 hits available in a combination of pdfs, online essays/articles and dusty books; some are brand new snake oil, others are cursed relics from the dawn of the .com bubble.  But there is not one mention of Laszlo Bock, who I argue is the Arbiter of effective HR practises, based purely on <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/google-parent-alphabet-joins-1-trillion-in-market-value-for-first-time-2020-01-16">the evidence</a>.  What Bock and the founders did was basic, but it’s anathema to the majority of businesses.  Because whilst simple, it is for some people impossibly hard, despite being one of the roots of Googles success:  discriminate properly and trust completely; select, assess the right people, and give them real autonomy.</p>
<p>This adult approach to being a human adult enables:</p>
<p><strong>Information transparency across the organisation</strong>, which allows higher up Intent to be communicated effectively (everyone has a better grasp of the big picture and where their actions fit into it, and second order effects etc).</p>
<p><strong>Output orientation vs ‘time served’ metrics</strong>; trying to measure an individual’s effective output with regards to quality and quantity is impossible to do effectively on any meaningful level.  Trust your team to know when they need to work out, sleep, and work on their projects.  Some people need to sprint, and you cannot sprint all the time.</p>
<p><strong>Recognition of management as an entirely separate facilitative skillset</strong>: <strong>Flat hierarchy</strong>.  People are valued on their merit/competence alone, and facilitators shouldn’t necessarily be paid more than the people they’re facilitating - or be more senior in the hierarchy.  By separating management from seniority as a separate vocational skill path, you get much more effective/actually effective managers, and much more successful teams.</p>
<p>On a basic level, what Google does right is discrimination.  Let’s be clear: everything the human brain does is a decision, every decision entails discrimination.  Physically discrimination is an essential component of reality.  Being aware of biases, implicit and otherwise, enables you to ensure that conscious and unconscious discrimination is tailored meritocratically and not biased illogically against people for arbitrary reasons.  If you don’t discriminate fairly and consistently, you end up with tyranny, and all the grimness that entails.  <strong>The ability to create and sustain a meritocratic environment where employees are empowered to be autonomous because they are trusted implicitly, is what puts Google on the cutting edge of common sense.</strong></p>
<p>To do any of this you need an effective assessment department, and an effective employment offer.  The former in particular normally falls under HR, who are expected to be relatively impartial.  But to do this properly – to select the right candidate who the company can trust implicitly – requires two things: 1. A good enough person(s) to do the selecting (and ensure the process is good enough) and 2. An applicant who’s good enough, because the offer is generous enough.</p>
<p>The reality is that the reason HR as a profession has such an abysmal reputation everywhere except for within HR itself, is because being common sense police and change management consultants requires a large degree of trust, control and talent.<br>
Companies will often treat their HR departments literally, like <em>‘human resources’</em>.  Far from being the marshals of meritocracy, they end up as poorly paid bean counters who lack any real authority and focus more on ruthlessly enforcing asinine and outdate processes (which act as a convenient shield), in order to save the bottom line in the short term.  They end up as payroll, trying to ‘cuff’ all the important stuff that’s often far beyond their behavioural and cognitive intelligence, or even worse – if they are talented they end up in a form of intellectual <strong>prison</strong>.  They leave, or collapse into themselves, having been forced to keep a steady pay check due to misfortune, until they are saved - one way or another.</p>
<p>Are HR to blame? Yes.  Partly.  But they’re not the cause.  That’s the jailor, who has the most to lose in challenging this paradigm: Hierarchical Management.  Specifically, a management process that resembles a bastardisation of medieval aristocracy and arbitrary Soviet career advancement.<br>
Management itself is a completely separate vocation.  However, mediocre businesses promote people to management positions based either on their vocational (non-management related) experience, or the fact that they’ve done the job before.  This means managers are often less competent than the people they employ, and barriers are thrown up in the face of younger, far more gifted personnel with a penchant for people skills.  This process creates gerontocracies with meritocratic elements, where time served is spectacularly overvalued as a metric for advancement.</p>
<p>It’s hard to have a flat hierarchy when the person involved is not the best person for the job.  Because they’re a great engineer, but they have the interpersonal skills of a menacing Crow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Management like leadership is a buzzword; useless without extrapolating and defining in a specific context; if something means 1000 things it’s meaningless in any shared reality.  In this article, let’s define management as the capability to facilitate and guide personnel in completing their assigned tasks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This article just focuses on the pre-cursors for an open, transparent culture in which employees are empowered according to their ability, and not governed by an arbitrary record of seniority propped up by outdated metrics such as ‘time served’. We as a species are slavishly addicted to measuring what can easily be quantified vs what needs to be.  Comfort is the enemy; change is difficult and people often focus on short term pain, not the long term gain with respect to changing workplace culture.</p>
<p>There’s an excellent moment in Bocks book where a Google HR employee attends a conference.  A VP from a rival company approaches her and excitedly exclaims that his organisation will soon be adopting Googles management and HR practices; they are getting a fun room for the employees to hand out in when they’re not working…  The Google exec points out that whilst this is a nice idea, they could try by first focusing on information transparency across the company so all employees feel attached and invested; at Google all meetings are recorded and available to be watched back through the org intranet.  “Oh no” the aghast VP says, they’d never go for that.  The point Bock makes is that all the fun obvious things associated with Google such as spaces to take a nap, are a 2nd order effect from what really matters – trust, empowerment transparency.</p>
<p>Businesses are afraid to discriminate effectively, because they lack the tools to do so; a culture of trust that attracts talent, and a department talented enough to lead the assessment.  Instead they hide behind processes under the guise of ‘fairness’, whilst in reality outsourcing the risk of bias to policies that are asinine in practise and wholly unaccountable.</p>
<p>Changing this requires addressing the cause: an outdated model of management correlated with seniority, that often results in an ineffective gerontocracy that attracts the new, the desperate and the mediocre.  Unfortunately, this cause is driven by it’s own hierarchy of needs to survive through protecting the status quo.  It requires a herculean effort of empowered change management or decades of evolving cultural trends to change this.  Until then, countless people will be frustrated with the unused bean bag playrooms and dead eyed corporate platitudes they’re forced to endure in lieu of meritocratic change.</p>
<p>Let’s not forget the corporate solution to a HR problem: spend a lot of money on overpriced HR consultants to point out the obvious to a HQ that can subsequently disregard the report.  Employees (who probably have some very good ideas) are further marginalised, the status quo is maintained, and the shareholders/ownership are happy.  Everyone (at HQ) wins.</p>

			<title>The Creative Writing Origin of QAnon</title>

			<description>Media outlets have failed to report the likely creative writing origins of QAnon. This oversight is extremely important with respect to undermining the narrative of shameless QAnon aficionados who have turned a creative writing exercise into something between a doomsday cult and a pyramid scheme, with real life consequences.
In November 2017 a YouTube video creator working with two moderators of the 4chan website, began plugging specific anonymous posts (dated October 2017) pulled from amidst the many conspiracy theories posted on 4chan.</description>
			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Media outlets have failed to report the likely creative writing origins of QAnon.  This oversight is extremely important with respect to undermining the narrative of shameless QAnon aficionados who have turned a creative writing exercise into something between a doomsday cult and a pyramid scheme, with real life consequences.<br>
In November 2017 a YouTube video creator working with two moderators of the 4chan website, began plugging specific anonymous posts (<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/12/qanon-4chan-the-storm-conspiracy-explained.html">dated October 2017</a>) pulled from amidst the many conspiracy theories posted on 4chan.</p>
<p>These conspiracy theories claimed they were authored by ‘Q’, who portended to be an anonymous high-ranking (US) military officer.  The theories therein espoused by Q – the world is run by an international child sacrifice and sexual abuse satanic cult controlled by senior democrats, only Donald Trump can save us – would result in QAnon transforming from conspiracy hobby to international cult with significant financial and political clout.</p>
<p>None of this is new information; it’s <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/how-three-conspiracy-theorists-took-q-sparked-qanon-n900531">well documented</a> that the 3 individuals who picked out these posts by ‘Q’ and plugged them, have benefitted financially from the increased digital footfall they’ve experienced through their respective platforms.  It’s theorised that they probably authored these comments, or at least assumed the writing mantle at some point.  What’s not been covered, despite the fact it’s easily accessible to anyone with an internet connection, is the likely creative writing origin of QAnon; True Detective series 1 and the more obscure MotherHorseEyes narrative.</p>
<p>Satanic child murdering orchestrated and participated in by politicians is lifted right out of True Detective.  A narrative as cartoony and shocking as this is not hard to come up with.  It may be coincidental, harkening back to Medieval notions of Satanically inspired nobles with a penchant for doing the worst thing they could think of.  But = it’s a significant coincidence.   In fact it is exactly the same story.  And True Detective Season 1 came out in 2014 to critical acclaim, causing a spike in popularity for The King in Yellow, anything Carcosa, and helped reinvigorate Lovecratian fandom with the incredible sense of cosmic despair the expertly crafted series instils in the viewer.<br>
A lot of people have seen the series or at least heard about it, and the parallels are obvious.  What isn’t as mainstream is what occurred in July 2016, just over a year before the first post by ‘Q’ in October 2017: the ‘creepypasta’ <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/9M9H9E9/wiki/narrative">creative writing narrative</a> authored by _9MOTHER9HORSE9EYES9 (mother horse eyes).
This entertaining narrative took the form of a series of reddit posts release between April and July 2016, detailing several emergent narratives that came together.  It reads like the pitch for an excellent sci fi novel about the humanities destruction/enslavement at the hands of a superior consciousness, with a strong current of ‘flesh horror’ throughout.  The piece introduced a sinister, anonymous, otherworldly presence that acts as the Big Bad/protagonist throughout, and named it ‘Q’.  What Q is, is to a degree open to interpretation.  Nothing more has been published.  There’s been no book detail, no explanation, just a Reddit entry that gained large traction on it’s way to being lucratively monetised… and then stopped.  A mysterious entity called Q, named in a creative writing project on Reddit that managed to receive coverage in well-respected British Newspaper <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/05/9mother9horse9eyes9-the-mysterious-tale-terrifying-reddit">The Guardian</a>, seemingly disappeared from the creative writing scene.</p>
<p>Barely more than a year later a fictional character called Q was telling us that our children were being trafficked by Democrats who wanted to ritually sacrifice them in the name of Satan.  The 3 Amigos of thought crime, or a separate QAnon author, could simply have picked a letter in the alphabet they thought sounded cool (James Bonds long suffering Scientist is called Q).  But given the audacious hack rip off/copy &amp; paste True Detective plot line, the fact that mother horse eyes was well known amongst the Reddit community and the authors were active participants, the time line looks like one hell of a coincidence:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_Detective_(season_1)">True Detective (2014)</a> &gt; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/9M9H9E9/wiki/narrative">9MOTHER9HORSE9EYES9 (2016)</a> &gt; <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-is-qanon-what-we-know-about-the-conspiracy-theory-11597694801">QAnon (2017)</a>.</p>
<p>Understanding this origin is essential to forming a rational picture of how the pieces came together.  Drawing attention to a Reddit piece about Flesh interfaces and cosmic horror -in order to frame the narrative origins of QAnon as a creative writing project monetised and subsequently weaponised - is a small but important battle in the war for our minds.  QAnon doesn’t end with TRUMP.  It has presented a monstrous narrative that railroads common sense into submission through emotive necessity, and has become the vehicle carrying numerous other conspiracies that may die or at least wither in isolation; vaccines are bad for you, 5G causes COVID, climate change is a lie, the Earth is flat.</p>
<p>As a species, from the earliest days of Palaeolithic campfires, we’ve thrived on stories; for the vast majority of our time of earth, oral tradition has been the primary means through which we preserve, modify and articulate our shared understanding of events and ideas.  This is reflected in the structure of our brain which is poorly optimised for written language analysis, compared with our capacity to communicate orally.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(This is covered in detail in the excellent ‘<a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/546526/grasp-by-sanjay-sarma-with-luke-yoquinto/">Grasp</a>’ by Sanjay Sarma and Luke Yoquinto.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whilst our methodology for communicating has evolved rapidly, with technology far outpacing biological adaptation, understanding narrative is still essential to understanding what information really is.  We may have sophisticated written languages and IT tools, but our brains are broadly the same.  Data is nothing without some kind of validity or ‘truth’ assessment – a method with which to weigh it’s likely veracity common in intelligence services.</p>
<p>Depending on the individual, conspiracy thinking is either a failure in rationalisation (born from insecurity and driven by necessity), intellectual laziness, or a combination exacerbated by evolution;  our brains are pattern recognition machines continually seeking to conserve energy.  Born from necessity to survive, this often leads to entrenched views/polarisation, confirmation bias and ‘logic traps’, wherein a shared subjective reality with arbitrary and transient rules often Trumps objective reality.  Objective reality is an elusive concept when as individuals we have only one point of 1st hand reference.  But it’s there, and striving towards it should be the aim of any person seeking to evolve beyond the architecture of our being.  Or at least try to lengthen the distance between human communities and Baboon rock.</p>
<p>Monetised and/or weaponised conspiracy theories threaten our cognitive development.  We live in an era where selfmade millionaires and professionals who graduated high school sometimes believe the world is flat.  Understanding the narrative - the story - behind the demise of common sense is overlooked at our peril.</p>

			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>To My Dear Comrade R, holed up in Sunny France…</p>
<p>A twisted Yuletide atmosphere is afoot in the UK this year. Christmas has been cancelled at the 11th hour by a sinister collective of political masochists, and a return to normality seems years away.  The UK itself is a bus being stubbornly driven in the direction of a No Deal Cliff Edge, with an unqualified ego centrist at the wheel and a cohort of passengers who would literally rather die than speak up in front of their peers.  Instead they gaze nervously out of the window, convincing the stranger next to them that either the cliff isn’t real or the valley floor is a wonderland of reduced Marks and Spencer Goodness, with prices slashed due to the lack of a Brussels Butter mountain tax.  Meanwhile the youth and the educated have fled to the back where they smoke poor quality weed and fantasise about carving a swastika into their Nans face.<br>
An Mp3 of Rule Britannia recorded by Bishops Heath 9-10 year school choir crackles in and out of silence on the semi broken bus radio.  A poor attempt to distract everyone from the lack of air conditioning and an onboard toilet that’s been blocked for years.  The Polish man who used to fix it is gone, and everyone else would rather just sit in their own filth waiting for employment fits around their Insta persona.</p>
<p>But amidst all this misery, a star was born.  One which had been spoken of in whispers for years past.  Promised but undelivered.   For a time it passed into mythology; a hero to save the salaried classes from their comfortable misery,  and allow them to wreak revenge on a virtual pastiche of the invisible hand they had so come to resent.  A game.  But not just any game.  THE game.  The best game of all time.  An immersive audio visual masterpiece to eclipse all that had come before: CYBERPUNK 2077.</p>
<p>But it didn’t go as planned…</p>
<p>And now you wonder, from your Parisian den of ill repute keeping one eye on your espresso and the other on the lookout for enthusiastic gendarmerie: “but how good is it really Daaave”.  Well, this is my 10 cents. It barely scratches the surface, but hopefully it will fill the yawning void of anticipation…</p>
<h3 id="the-short">The Short:</h3>
<p>It is one of the best games of all time, that does nothing new mechanically.  It will be one of the best versions of the mechanics it contains, but right now it’s one Beta development cycle away from being the experience people were expecting.  Despite this, even on my hardware it manages a truly unique feat: being simultaneously the most minorly buggy and smoothest running modern game I’ve ever played.  And it’s lots of fun.  And I love the story and the setting.  Just don’t expect the revolution here, or anywhere else for that matter.</p>
<h3 id="the-long-spoiler-free">The Long (Spoiler Free):</h3>
<p><strong>Actually playing it:</strong>  In the beginning there were enemies.  And they seemed to be made of cyber skin impervious to bullets.  Either that or your bullets were made of the same foam used to make Nerf darts.  But then you checked your inventory and realised you had a Katana with 3 x the DPS, and quickly discovered that sprinting at your enemies waving your sword like a lunatic screaming ‘I AM SPONGE DEATH’ whilst rapidly jabbing the ‘use health kit’ button, guaranteed success for at least the first 90 mins.  You quickly discovered that this was more fulfilling than creep crouching around like a pantomime Fred West at a Women’s Refuge.</p>
<p>Despite that, the combat is actually fun.  None of this ‘well it’s a good game rpg/mmorpg and the combat doesn’t make me want to climb a bell tower and start chimping’.  It is actually satisfying.  When you get some more powerful guns 2 hours in.  Before that the Katana rage tactic is surprisingly cathartic.
Stealth is nothing special, but works very well.  Plaudits to the level designers.  Presumably if you’ve suffered a mental breakdown and fancy playing this for 200 hours over the course of a week, an entirely stealthy play through is possible.  But, cutting cyborg gangbangers heads off with a sword when you catch them running a snuff clinic is infinitely more satisfying.  Although, looking at the 10 million units sold, the games clearly going to be played by some mentalists, so have it comrades.</p>
<p>The Netrunning side of it is largely missing.  Given the prevalence of the cyberspace realm in the original book, and spin offs such as Android Netrunner, it’s clear this could have been a vast game within the meta game.  But it’s not here.  It’s missing.  Lying dead on the cutting room floor so a 12 year old with a 30 year console can spend hours giggling over the vagina/penis options in 5FPS low res hell.  The hacking that does exist works at least, and the quick hacks in combat add a satisfying if simple extra dimension to puzzle solving your way through a mission.</p>
<p>As the game moves on, combat and looting get’s more and more fun with a very satisfying array of weapons, crafting and subsequent scrounging.  The world itself is enormous, and an absolute treat.  I’ve barely scratched the service.  Mission management is similar to the Witcher, with side quests and gigs generated through your progression and encounters.  There’s also random mad shit that happens, such as interrupting a drug deal or cleaning up the streets.  It’s satisfying to chance upon an organised crime deal going to down;  the phone rings, it’s the police dispatcher.  You’re pulled in by the lure of a hero complex, promise of dollar dollar bills and the potential for a shiny new shirt or sniper rifle.  Next moment you find yourself in a biblical scrap and when you eventually emerge victorious, you’ve completely forgotten what you were trying to do.  This plethora of simple yet satisfying activity in an enormous city is excellent.</p>
<p>Crafting’s in the game, and adds an effective means to ensure you can have a reasonable stab at equipping yourself the way you want to, otherwise you’re reliant on what the vendors are selling.  The Cyberware enhancements are fun and work well, dramatically improving your survivability and providing abilities such as double jump and fold out arm swords [there is a way to get legendary mantis arm blades for free – which is the only cheaty thing I recommend looking up].</p>
<p>The Story is enormously satisfying, but I am a captive audience.  Don’t expect True Detective Series 1 levels of craftsmanship, it’s mostly quite simple.  But, in the same vane as the Witcher, many of the plot pieces and side hustles are excellently scripted and suitably harrowing for this beautiful dystopia.
One particular thing I’ve noticed is that loading times are very quick, which makes the below easier to grapple with…</p>
<p><strong>The bugs.</strong>  I can hear the spiders scratching at the insides of your brain, whispering doubts and promises of disappointment; perhaps you’ll hit play and find your freezer cooled GPU reduced to slag.  The bugs are minor and prolific, mostly graphical, and often solved by reloading.  For a minority of players they are a game killer; one particular favourite is that your save games break if they get too big through crafting prolifically (??).  You simply have to roll the dice with what you’ve got.  But you’ll probably be ok.  I’ll extrapolate conservatively/rant aggressively about why these bugs are here at all later in the article [on Sunday the studio admitted the assertion that many have made; they tried to make a next gen game for a last gen console.  Because, money * shareholders / financial forecasts].</p>
<p><strong>The Reviews:</strong> So many poor reviews.  It’s understandable with respect to the bugs, the reviewer version of the game was in even poorer shape than the launch.  Even if we know most of these will eventually be fixed.  But many criticised the game itself for not being ‘new’ or ‘innovative’. WTF did reviewers expect?  It’s like being promised the second coming and meeting a friendly Israeli guy who builds you a beautiful table and let’s you use his home gym.  You’ve got a sweet deal but you can’t help resenting the fact that your ludicrous-to-the point-of-being-abstractly-fictional-expectations were not fulfilled.  There will be no truly innovative AAA games until the industry sees innovative technology.  The same issues that affect video games now, affected them in the 90’s; the AIs difficult to program and scale, visuals are capped by the mean state of technology within the demographic you’re appealing to, and all current technology is just a better, faster more powerful version of what came before.  There are promising signs of change with respect to super computers application in programming and scaling AI in addition to pre-rendering 4 &amp; 8k visuals for various chipsets.  But until working the cost in terms of money and time into a developmental cycle becomes standard, this will remain fringe.  If Cyberpunks reviews highlighted anything, it’s how arbitrary a number score can be when the criteria are not accurately unpacked.  Hence my attempt at the end of this to quantify my judgement of the work.
But why all the bugs?</p>
<p><strong>They got greedy.</strong>  The 8-year enterprise is atypical of the current state of gaming economics.  Being driven entirely by short termist shareholder interest, CDPR had no practical choice but to appeal to the widest section of playable society they theoretically could.  They were forced by the status quo of AAA economics to make their game playable on 2 generations of console, the second not being released until 2 months before the eventual game release.  This was despite the fact that this was first and foremost a PC release, taking advantage of a revolution of GPU power in relative terms.  This ridiculous technological balancing act meant they sacrificed features for player count, and were at best naive, if not outright liars regarding the release date to attract shareholder interest and pre-release investment.  Their rhetoric undid them in the end, and the game became too big to delay any further, with Christmas 2020 set to be too lucrative a period for the investors to miss out on.</p>
<p>The Fall of Cyberpunk, at least in the immediate future, is a fitting allegory for short term market economics strangling and frustrating the capacity of the human race to realise it’s technological potential.  Whilst it is only a video game, it’s popularity transcends boundaries of frivolity to make a poignant point; the supposedly exponential curve of technology is being curb stomped by short term economics.  What this means for Video games is more of the same: Indie games will push the boundaries of mechanics, relying predominantly on PC power and KBM input to realise untapped potential, whereas the Audio Visual AAA overheads with their requisite exorbitant development costs will remain trapped in dealing with the lowest common denominator; console customers with last years GPU masquerading as a computation system.</p>
<p>budget gaming is set to continue to be apolitical, unartistic and certainly not innovative.  We can only hope for the Half Life exceptions that somehow break through.
Until Supercomputers are commonly used to develop (and scale) innovative systems such as gaming AI and visual performance, the revolution is one giant fuck off wall of economic NOPE away.  Expect more of the same, but gradually prettier.  Forever.</p>
<p>Having a layer of non-developing Suit management living in Narnia and conjuring PowerPoint charts made of dreams and pixel art for hungry CDPR investors certainly didn’t help.  A noticeable quirk of the industry, and perhaps part of the reason behind the success of indie studios (and the existence of the Early Access model), is that in the most critically successful studios the layer of Suit management between Investor and Developer is largely absent, or at least silent.  Given that large studios are the only organisations with the resources to produce AAA titles, the future of depressingly ordinary.</p>
<p>Putting away the whisky and the soapbox, does any of this matter for playing Cyberpunk?  No.  It’s a very fun game, one of the best ever made provided your hardware doesn’t produce game breaking bugs and you dig the aesthetic.  I’m having lots of fun – I am addicted.  And I’m still amazed at how smooth the experience is on my modest laptop.  But it has made me realise how very far away the future is.</p>

			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="trn-initial-assertion">TRN Initial Assertion:</h2>
<p>#Metoo, BLM, and other movements striving for justice within a given social and/or geographic space have been partly consumed by an all-encompassing, homogenous movement (despite its heterogeneous roots) that has become known as Woke culture. Far from creating a new renaissance for equality and meritocracy, this movement is damaging the evolution of human rights by dismissing moderates, liberals and rationalists,  It has been high-jacked or subsumed by a generational groundswell of anxiety addled, predominantly Caucasian, ardent reactionaries.</p>
<p>This group is abusing political and social imperatives, such as developing expectations with regards to sexual and gender identity, to furiously assault any mechanism through which their bubble of emotional sanctity may be breached.  This cult of anxiety embodies all the characteristics of an overtly emotive and irrational religion that remains stubbornly dissonant from facts.  It may harm or destroy the vital causes and vulnerable people it seeks to champion.</p>
<p>It is anti-liberal in its assault of pretensions to rationality, and anti-conservation in its attempts to deny or destroy history by preventing objective based discourse that may incite emotive offense within a protected social margin.
Ironically in attempting to support the notion of natural equality amongst humans (a central tenant of the French revolution), it has inadvertently become a form of fascism synonymous with the repression of rational thought, repression of history and proposed dominance of cultural norms that suit a hyper-reactive fringe group.</p>
<p>Any movement regardless of intention that moves humanity away from the objective to the subjective with respect to our shared collective reality is toxic.  It’s popularity will causate with the ability for cruel fringe elements to enjoy increased influence within the political stratum. Current generations must be forced to become comfortable with being uncomfortable in order to ensure the shared delusion of society is as close to the facts as possible; it’s through intellectual and physical rigour that we learn to alleviate our anxiety without eroding the delicate framework that exists to propel society towards a fairer and more meritocratic existence. Our academic institutions must be immune from emotive dissent whilst providing a rational forum within which it can be expressed.</p>
<p>Wokeness has noble ambitions, but like most emotive political movements, it has regressed into yet another ugly, repressive source of polarisation.</p>
<p>Pragmatic compassion is needed now more than ever or we risk de-volving as culture.</p>
<h3 id="m">M:</h3>
<p>Something that is missing is the fact that a driver for the Woke culture is the fact that our generation and GenZ even more lack patience so people want to see change ASAP and become more aggressive.</p>
<p>The other thing is the mention of objective v. subjective. I get that you are trying to establish that rational debate cannot be marred with appeals to emotions w/o facts but it&rsquo;s undeniable that emotions need to be involved to inspire masses and to promote a cultural change.</p>
<p>The fact that &ldquo;social justice movements&rdquo; are tackling multidisciplinary interconnected problems means that it&rsquo;s too difficult to have purely fact-based discussions and that&rsquo;s why they devolve to appeals to consciousness and ignore rationality. The other consequence is that correlation between a lot of factors gives plenty of opportunities for status quo proponents to handpick &ldquo;facts&rdquo; that are contrary to where we should be as a society.  Or (as seen from several conservatives nowadays) gish-gallop to reduce the influence from the other debating side, by reinforcing dated views while putting the onus on them to sift through the crap.</p>
<h3 id="trn">TRN:</h3>
<p>I agree.  I believe the wider generational issue is one of a lack of applied behavioural intelligence; I’ll quantify that as a lack of basic behavioural competence such as patience, anxiety management and/or impulse control.  This is exacerbated by the seemingly exponential increase in the speed with which information travels (and the unlimited breadth of audience), correlated with autonomous segmentation due to market oriented algorithms. As a result I think any emotive issue becomes characterised by behaviour adults would not tolerate in children.</p>
<p>The architecture for debate and cognitive development in general has not kept up with societal expectations or the increased glut in non-provable information.  The Medieval equivalent believe the mad raving alchemist because they guessed gravity right. Now everyone sleeps with a pig ear under the pillow so faeries don’t eat their nose.  Better safe than sorry.</p>
<p>Exacerbating all of this is a complete failure to instil Utopian thinking within 1st world democracies; without a concept of what we want Society to be and what we don&rsquo;t want it to be, there&rsquo;s no shared reality from which to infer recognisable meaning, or shared context.  The result is a fractured mess of echo chambers, some well-intentioned others not, being wittingly preyed upon by market algorithms looking for short term shareholder gains. Belief in the FreeMarket as an self-writing ecosystem is itself a religion.  It challenges all hints of regulation control as being antithetical or even heretical for what is &lsquo;good&rsquo; for our future as a race.</p>
<p>It’s impossible to imagine a world without some model of capitalism short of a Science Fiction techno revolution; we are all monkeys after all.  But FreeMarket capitalism has transcended from economic system to religion, or even cult.  FreeMarket is a pernicious system within which democratically elected control or influence of the system is viciously assaulted in the minds of the electorate, with economic devastation being the hell on earth waiting for heretics who question it’s modus operandi. It is itself a macro level algorithm propagated by a tiny minority of wealth accumulators, for whom long term devastation is a irrelevant where their short term financial success.</p>
<p>It is enabled through it’s dark marriage with religion; most importantly conservative septs of Christianity within the USA (which is the primary arbiter of State sanctioned FreeMarket/anti-regulation doctrine).  Why worry that the Future of humanity as at stake, when an omnipresent trans-dimensional space wizard can fix everything with a click of it’s/His fingers?</p>
<p>Also, [erhaps the historical roots of the FreeMarket religion are at least partly reflected in the birth of ecology, which became a Gaian movement proposing that the Earth was a perfect self-righting organism.  <strong>Since disproven by reality</strong>.  <em>I would also refer to our Saurian ancestors for comment if they hadn’t been annihilated by an explosive cause of wrong place wrong time.</em></p>
<p>Whilst notions of utopia conjure horrifying visions of atrocities, in reality when politics doesn&rsquo;t provide a vision of the future that space is filled by reactionary fear mongers and asinine short term corporate interest (that ironically hurts the bottom line in the long run). In this context fascism wins, which means we all lose.</p>
<p>A world run by short term commercial interest will kill us off long before we can evolve in a sustainable and compassionate manner.  The FreeMarket religion is a paradigm that needs to be shattered for survival, let alone happiness.  A cult of anxiety is not going to help – anxious people make anxious choices.</p>
<p>Also I don&rsquo;t think younger generations aren’t any less intelligent objectively, rather all generations appear less intelligent in practise due to the outdated architecture for regulating communication on any large scale. I think younger generations have it even harder because they lack any firsthand context for being unconnected and forced to debate amongst peers. Private education can compensate for this but state education is typically under the intellectual yolk of Skinners asinine views that amount to bureaucratic narcissism. The toxic heart of this is buoyed by a FreeMarket hegemony pandering to the cult of anxiety that will figuratively devour adult children. No one feels good being made to feel uncomfortable, but it’s an absolute requirement for empathic and effective people.  Without a strong academic architecture to support the critical development of young people, we are in a bad place</p>
<h3 id="m-1">M:</h3>
<p>Going back to the bread of that sandwich. It&rsquo;s a mix of expectations, effort and nature which as you rightly point out is playing against the very folk that want to drive change.</p>
<p><em>Effort:</em> People being lazy thinkers is not new. Hell, half of the discussion points from the fathers of philosophy are just about the nature of questioning and forming opinion with calculated distance to be aware of discoveries from an opposing point of view. That was already difficult when there was no printing press and most information travelled slowly. We&rsquo;ve discussed this aplenty but it&rsquo;s part of the problem and I feel that there is a resurgence of methods and frameworks to analyse information after the whole fake news debacle but that matters only to people willing to put the effort. In a world of blogs, blue checkmarks and &ldquo;content&rdquo;, it is easy to be an expert and have followers even if you talk pure crap. Fox News being a great example.</p>
<p><em>Expectations:</em> We are exposed to all kinds of information all the time in an era where we&rsquo;ve done more in 150 years to radically change society over and over than most of recorded history combined. We are all expected to have strong opinions fast, to be able to discuss matters across all subjects and to keep up with the order of the day. That is combined with effort above&hellip; What is the minimum effort necessary to keep up with those expectations?</p>
<p><em>Nature:</em> The echo chamber. Feeling good. Avoiding confrontation and getting endorphins from group-wide acknowledgement. It&rsquo;s very difficult to escape any of these things for any of us. We didn&rsquo;t grow up on TikTok politics but if I had I wonder how much effort I would invest in getting out of that cycle. Hell&hellip; Our elders love the f**ing WhatsApp chains because it makes them feel good, like they hold some truth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all combined and exactly as you&rsquo;re saying. The current gen is expected to hold more information, tackle more areas, sift through more sources, still overcome our nature to recognise patters and trends even when they&rsquo;re not there and fight back in the same establishment that was designed for a different era.</p>
<p>Some of the questions on your original essay still stand though. Being subjective, keeping up with anxiety, wanting to solve issues before the next problem highlighted hours in the future comes along, seem to be consequences rather than root causes. Is there something more fundamental missing to prevent Woke culture from swallowing and distorting the movements created, to address real and fundamental issues in our society as it stands?</p>
<h3 id="trn-1">TRN:</h3>
<p>The Fascist tendencies of woke culture, however ironic and self -destructive, are the result of the architecture (or lack of) that we have for regulating the flow, consideration and articulation of information, which is partly driven by a short termist exponential growth market algorithm which I truly believe has become an evangelical religion, and largely impervious to questioning/rationalisation.</p>
<p>The long-term goals of regulating and orienting the market towards ascribing value based on the future we want humanity to experience is a lofty goal.  A shared sense of Utopia is mostly limited to cultural platitudes riven with fault lines (such as secular governance vs non governance).  However, there are generic shared realities that are innate within all of us; for example our physical, mental and emotional reliance on the environment.  Despite this, regulating a system controlled by the US hegemony in the age of the bi partisan Republican is daunting, if not unachievable.</p>
<p>In terms of what fundamental can be addressed that is practically achievable, basic critical thinking and behavioural skills are more important than ever, to equip humans for the unrelenting barrage of anxious cruelty they are assailed with the moment they connect with any (social)media.  To accomplish this, the education system should be gutted and completed re-designed.  It should orientate foundationally around the behavioural skillset that society wants to see in a productive, mentally healthy citizen, that is intellectually equipped to exercise sufficient patience and purpose in moving the societal agenda for equality further towards a sane/pragmatic conception of meritocracy.  <em>Whilst safeguarding the basic requirement to have a discourse around a topic that inspires differing opinions.</em></p>
<p>The public education of the population majority is perhaps the silver bullet for necessitating change in the age of technology and time is limited; the techno aristocracy (i.e. Googles owners) will literally die out and be replaced by faceless shareholder interest within a generation or two.  The opportunity to seize conscious control of the zeitgeist will perhaps be lost.</p>
<p>With education using a therapy approach to instilling a love for learning underpinned by the development of a cognitive and behavioural skillset fit for a secular, rational society, we will garden a kinder world.</p>
<p>Whilst this too appears to be ludicrously optimistic, that hard part; the infrastructure, the laws forcing young people to be there etc, is taken care of.  What’s holding us back?  I think a lack of requirement analysis which is the result of an invisible future, obscured by a miasma of Reaganite nothing politics is to blame.  Some Western countries are terrible at planning beyond year long ministerial appointments that serve a party leader and not the public sector (when’s the last time any minister of education was a former teacher?)/</p>
<p>I think you hit the nail by referring to &ldquo;social justice movements […] tackling multidisciplinary interconnected problems”.  In this environment the most provocative meme takes social precedence.  It’s perhaps too late for us, but if we act now we can save the next generation, and maybe even undo some of the harm.</p>
<p>A requirement analysis of our respective countries national curriculums oriented around behavioural intelligence/critical thinking skills development, in order to produce more considerate citizens, is the silver artillery shell we are looking for.</p>
