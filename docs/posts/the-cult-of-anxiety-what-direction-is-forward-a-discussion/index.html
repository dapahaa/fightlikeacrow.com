<p>#Metoo, BLM, and other movements striving for justice within a given social and/or geographic space have been partly consumed by an all-encompassing, homogenous movement (despite its heterogeneous roots) that has become known as Woke culture. Far from creating a new renaissance for equality and meritocracy, this movement is damaging the evolution of human rights by dismissing moderates, liberals and rationalists,  It has been high-jacked or subsumed by a generational groundswell of anxiety addled, predominantly Caucasian, ardent reactionaries.</p>
<p>This group is abusing political and social imperatives, such as developing expectations with regards to sexual and gender identity, to furiously assault any mechanism through which their bubble of emotional sanctity may be breached.  This cult of anxiety embodies all the characteristics of an overtly emotive and irrational religion that remains stubbornly dissonant from facts.  It may harm or destroy the vital causes and vulnerable people it seeks to champion.</p>
<p>It is anti-liberal in its assault of pretensions to rationality, and anti-conservation in its attempts to deny or destroy history by preventing objective based discourse that may incite emotive offense within a protected social margin.
Ironically in attempting to support the notion of natural equality amongst humans (a central tenant of the French revolution), it has inadvertently become a form of fascism synonymous with the repression of rational thought, repression of history and proposed dominance of cultural norms that suit a hyper-reactive fringe group.</p>
<p>Any movement regardless of intention that moves humanity away from the objective to the subjective with respect to our shared collective reality is toxic.  It’s popularity will causate with the ability for cruel fringe elements to enjoy increased influence within the political stratum. Current generations must be forced to become comfortable with being uncomfortable in order to ensure the shared delusion of society is as close to the facts as possible; it’s through intellectual and physical rigour that we learn to alleviate our anxiety without eroding the delicate framework that exists to propel society towards a fairer and more meritocratic existence. Our academic institutions must be immune from emotive dissent whilst providing a rational forum within which it can be expressed.</p>
<p>Wokeness has noble ambitions, but like most emotive political movements, it has regressed into yet another ugly, repressive source of polarisation.</p>
<p>Pragmatic compassion is needed now more than ever or we risk de-volving as culture.</p>
<h3 id="m">M:<a href="#m" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h3>
<p>Something that is missing is the fact that a driver for the Woke culture is the fact that our generation and GenZ even more lack patience so people want to see change ASAP and become more aggressive.</p>
<p>The other thing is the mention of objective v. subjective. I get that you are trying to establish that rational debate cannot be marred with appeals to emotions w/o facts but it&rsquo;s undeniable that emotions need to be involved to inspire masses and to promote a cultural change.</p>
<p>The fact that &ldquo;social justice movements&rdquo; are tackling multidisciplinary interconnected problems means that it&rsquo;s too difficult to have purely fact-based discussions and that&rsquo;s why they devolve to appeals to consciousness and ignore rationality. The other consequence is that correlation between a lot of factors gives plenty of opportunities for status quo proponents to handpick &ldquo;facts&rdquo; that are contrary to where we should be as a society.  Or (as seen from several conservatives nowadays) gish-gallop to reduce the influence from the other debating side, by reinforcing dated views while putting the onus on them to sift through the crap.</p>
<h3 id="trn">TRN:<a href="#trn" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h3>
<p>I agree.  I believe the wider generational issue is one of a lack of applied behavioural intelligence; I’ll quantify that as a lack of basic behavioural competence such as patience, anxiety management and/or impulse control.  This is exacerbated by the seemingly exponential increase in the speed with which information travels (and the unlimited breadth of audience), correlated with autonomous segmentation due to market oriented algorithms. As a result I think any emotive issue becomes characterised by behaviour adults would not tolerate in children.</p>
<p>The architecture for debate and cognitive development in general has not kept up with societal expectations or the increased glut in non-provable information.  The Medieval equivalent believe the mad raving alchemist because they guessed gravity right. Now everyone sleeps with a pig ear under the pillow so faeries don’t eat their nose.  Better safe than sorry.</p>
<p>Exacerbating all of this is a complete failure to instil Utopian thinking within 1st world democracies; without a concept of what we want Society to be and what we don&rsquo;t want it to be, there&rsquo;s no shared reality from which to infer recognisable meaning, or shared context.  The result is a fractured mess of echo chambers, some well-intentioned others not, being wittingly preyed upon by market algorithms looking for short term shareholder gains. Belief in the FreeMarket as an self-writing ecosystem is itself a religion.  It challenges all hints of regulation control as being antithetical or even heretical for what is &lsquo;good&rsquo; for our future as a race.</p>
<p>It’s impossible to imagine a world without some model of capitalism short of a Science Fiction techno revolution; we are all monkeys after all.  But FreeMarket capitalism has transcended from economic system to religion, or even cult.  FreeMarket is a pernicious system within which democratically elected control or influence of the system is viciously assaulted in the minds of the electorate, with economic devastation being the hell on earth waiting for heretics who question it’s modus operandi. It is itself a macro level algorithm propagated by a tiny minority of wealth accumulators, for whom long term devastation is a irrelevant where their short term financial success.</p>
<p>It is enabled through it’s dark marriage with religion; most importantly conservative septs of Christianity within the USA (which is the primary arbiter of State sanctioned FreeMarket/anti-regulation doctrine).  Why worry that the Future of humanity as at stake, when an omnipresent trans-dimensional space wizard can fix everything with a click of it’s/His fingers?</p>
<p>Also, [erhaps the historical roots of the FreeMarket religion are at least partly reflected in the birth of ecology, which became a Gaian movement proposing that the Earth was a perfect self-righting organism.  <strong>Since disproven by reality</strong>.  <em>I would also refer to our Saurian ancestors for comment if they hadn’t been annihilated by an explosive cause of wrong place wrong time.</em></p>
<p>Whilst notions of utopia conjure horrifying visions of atrocities, in reality when politics doesn&rsquo;t provide a vision of the future that space is filled by reactionary fear mongers and asinine short term corporate interest (that ironically hurts the bottom line in the long run). In this context fascism wins, which means we all lose.</p>
<p>A world run by short term commercial interest will kill us off long before we can evolve in a sustainable and compassionate manner.  The FreeMarket religion is a paradigm that needs to be shattered for survival, let alone happiness.  A cult of anxiety is not going to help – anxious people make anxious choices.</p>
<p>Also I don&rsquo;t think younger generations aren’t any less intelligent objectively, rather all generations appear less intelligent in practise due to the outdated architecture for regulating communication on any large scale. I think younger generations have it even harder because they lack any firsthand context for being unconnected and forced to debate amongst peers. Private education can compensate for this but state education is typically under the intellectual yolk of Skinners asinine views that amount to bureaucratic narcissism. The toxic heart of this is buoyed by a FreeMarket hegemony pandering to the cult of anxiety that will figuratively devour adult children. No one feels good being made to feel uncomfortable, but it’s an absolute requirement for empathic and effective people.  Without a strong academic architecture to support the critical development of young people, we are in a bad place</p>

<p>Going back to the bread of that sandwich. It&rsquo;s a mix of expectations, effort and nature which as you rightly point out is playing against the very folk that want to drive change.</p>
<p><em>Effort:</em> People being lazy thinkers is not new. Hell, half of the discussion points from the fathers of philosophy are just about the nature of questioning and forming opinion with calculated distance to be aware of discoveries from an opposing point of view. That was already difficult when there was no printing press and most information travelled slowly. We&rsquo;ve discussed this aplenty but it&rsquo;s part of the problem and I feel that there is a resurgence of methods and frameworks to analyse information after the whole fake news debacle but that matters only to people willing to put the effort. In a world of blogs, blue checkmarks and &ldquo;content&rdquo;, it is easy to be an expert and have followers even if you talk pure crap. Fox News being a great example.</p>
<p><em>Expectations:</em> We are exposed to all kinds of information all the time in an era where we&rsquo;ve done more in 150 years to radically change society over and over than most of recorded history combined. We are all expected to have strong opinions fast, to be able to discuss matters across all subjects and to keep up with the order of the day. That is combined with effort above&hellip; What is the minimum effort necessary to keep up with those expectations?</p>
<p><em>Nature:</em> The echo chamber. Feeling good. Avoiding confrontation and getting endorphins from group-wide acknowledgement. It&rsquo;s very difficult to escape any of these things for any of us. We didn&rsquo;t grow up on TikTok politics but if I had I wonder how much effort I would invest in getting out of that cycle. Hell&hellip; Our elders love the f**ing WhatsApp chains because it makes them feel good, like they hold some truth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all combined and exactly as you&rsquo;re saying. The current gen is expected to hold more information, tackle more areas, sift through more sources, still overcome our nature to recognise patters and trends even when they&rsquo;re not there and fight back in the same establishment that was designed for a different era.</p>
<p>Some of the questions on your original essay still stand though. Being subjective, keeping up with anxiety, wanting to solve issues before the next problem highlighted hours in the future comes along, seem to be consequences rather than root causes. Is there something more fundamental missing to prevent Woke culture from swallowing and distorting the movements created, to address real and fundamental issues in our society as it stands?</p>
<h3 id="trn-1">TRN:<a href="#trn-1" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h3>
<p>The Fascist tendencies of woke culture, however ironic and self -destructive, are the result of the architecture (or lack of) that we have for regulating the flow, consideration and articulation of information, which is partly driven by a short termist exponential growth market algorithm which I truly believe has become an evangelical religion, and largely impervious to questioning/rationalisation.</p>
<p>The long-term goals of regulating and orienting the market towards ascribing value based on the future we want humanity to experience is a lofty goal.  A shared sense of Utopia is mostly limited to cultural platitudes riven with fault lines (such as secular governance vs non governance).  However, there are generic shared realities that are innate within all of us; for example our physical, mental and emotional reliance on the environment.  Despite this, regulating a system controlled by the US hegemony in the age of the bi partisan Republican is daunting, if not unachievable.</p>
<p>In terms of what fundamental can be addressed that is practically achievable, basic critical thinking and behavioural skills are more important than ever, to equip humans for the unrelenting barrage of anxious cruelty they are assailed with the moment they connect with any (social)media.  To accomplish this, the education system should be gutted and completed re-designed.  It should orientate foundationally around the behavioural skillset that society wants to see in a productive, mentally healthy citizen, that is intellectually equipped to exercise sufficient patience and purpose in moving the societal agenda for equality further towards a sane/pragmatic conception of meritocracy.  <em>Whilst safeguarding the basic requirement to have a discourse around a topic that inspires differing opinions.</em></p>
<p>The public education of the population majority is perhaps the silver bullet for necessitating change in the age of technology and time is limited; the techno aristocracy (i.e. Googles owners) will literally die out and be replaced by faceless shareholder interest within a generation or two.  The opportunity to seize conscious control of the zeitgeist will perhaps be lost.</p>
<p>With education using a therapy approach to instilling a love for learning underpinned by the development of a cognitive and behavioural skillset fit for a secular, rational society, we will garden a kinder world.</p>
<p>Whilst this too appears to be ludicrously optimistic, that hard part; the infrastructure, the laws forcing young people to be there etc, is taken care of.  What’s holding us back?  I think a lack of requirement analysis which is the result of an invisible future, obscured by a miasma of Reaganite nothing politics is to blame.  Some Western countries are terrible at planning beyond year long ministerial appointments that serve a party leader and not the public sector (when’s the last time any minister of education was a former teacher?)/</p>
<p>I think you hit the nail by referring to &ldquo;social justice movements […] tackling multidisciplinary interconnected problems”.  In this environment the most provocative meme takes social precedence.  It’s perhaps too late for us, but if we act now we can save the next generation, and maybe even undo some of the harm.</p>
<p>A requirement analysis of our respective countries national curriculums oriented around behavioural intelligence/critical thinking skills development, in order to produce more considerate citizens, is the silver artillery shell we are looking for.</p>
