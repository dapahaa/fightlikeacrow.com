      <description>Media outlets have failed to report the likely creative writing origins of QAnon. This oversight is extremely important with respect to undermining the narrative of shameless QAnon aficionados who have turned a creative writing exercise into something between a doomsday cult and a pyramid scheme, with real life consequences.
