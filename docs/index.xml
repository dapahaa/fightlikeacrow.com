      <description>Google is namedropped when somebody wants to demonstrate success, innovation or an overwhelmingly positive work environment (we’ll save toxic echo chamber algorithms for another day). The name of the company has become a buzzword for marrying financial success with employee satisfaction; ‘Googles strategy for happy employees boosts it’s bottom line’. It shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone. In an increasingly globalised world, many companies have good ideas, but the company with the best people is going to come out on top.</description>

      <description>Media outlets have failed to report the likely creative writing origins of QAnon. This oversight is extremely important with respect to undermining the narrative of shameless QAnon aficionados who have turned a creative writing exercise into something between a doomsday cult and a pyramid scheme, with real life consequences.
In November 2017 a YouTube video creator working with two moderators of the 4chan website, began plugging specific anonymous posts (dated October 2017) pulled from amidst the many conspiracy theories posted on 4chan.</description>

      <description>To My Dear Comrade R, holed up in Sunny France…
A twisted Yuletide atmosphere is afoot in the UK this year. Christmas has been cancelled at the 11th hour by a sinister collective of political masochists, and a return to normality seems years away. The UK itself is a bus being stubbornly driven in the direction of a No Deal Cliff Edge, with an unqualified ego centrist at the wheel and a cohort of passengers who would literally rather die than speak up in front of their peers.</description>

      <description>TRN Initial Assertion: #Metoo, BLM, and other movements striving for justice within a given social and/or geographic space have been partly consumed by an all-encompassing, homogenous movement (despite its heterogeneous roots) that has become known as Woke culture. Far from creating a new renaissance for equality and meritocracy, this movement is damaging the evolution of human rights by dismissing moderates, liberals and rationalists, It has been high-jacked or subsumed by a generational groundswell of anxiety addled, predominantly Caucasian, ardent reactionaries.</description>

      <title>About The Reluctant Nihilist</title>

      <description>Beneath the skin of any Nihilist lingers the corpse of an empathic soul disappointed with this shitshow. Humanity is not a virus like the eco-fascists would have us believe. But we do appear to be in an evolutionary stage of &amp;lsquo;viral activity&amp;rsquo;.
Insecurity is the mother of all fuckups. Most at least. Scared people often make poor choices.
The Earth is flat, vaccines are dangerous. The Amazon rainforest is worth more as toilet paper than as a rainforest.</description>
