      <description>Morality is a subjective thing. It is fluid, and subject itself to definition given that it’s meaning can vary wildly. Context is king. Morality itself isn’t a complicated issue so much as one that requires hard work, nuance and patience to understand because it changes and evolves depending upon the stakes and the context, because it is at it’s root an opinion. It’s far more satisfying to forgo this nuance, over simply an issue and simply rage; levying moral issues into righteous superiority.</description>
