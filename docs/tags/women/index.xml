      <description>Companies, Governments and 3rd sector organisations are cynically exploiting popularist liberty movements to avoid addressing the most serious fault line in Western societies; gender equality and the re-distribution of care giver equity (ensuring that society is structured to minimise career disruption and thus discrimination due to caregiving).
